1. ยง  (1) Don't forget
            1. There can be numeric points.
            2. with subpoints like
                a) subpoint 1,
                b) subpoint 2.
            3. So there's that.
      (2) Oh by the way
            a) It can be
                1. The other way around too
                2. just so you know.
            b) Man, this sucks.
      (3) By the way 2, if there is only one point reference like
          a) we still should not parse it as points,
          because it's wrong.
      (4) This is especially true if there is a fake numeric point like
          1. but then there are
          a) one real subpoint
          b) two real subpoints
          Then it should be alphabetic subpoints.
          Even without indentation.
      (5) This is especially true if there is a fake numeric point like
          1. but then there are
          a) one real subpoint
          b) two real subpoints
          However, if there is
          2. another point, then we can do nothing but have
          numeric subpoints. Such is life.
